    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Gimbap (김밥), also romanized as kimbap, is a Korean dish made from 
        cooked rice and ingredients such as vegetables, fish, and meats that 
        are rolled in gim—dried sheets of seaweed—and served 
        in bite-sized slices. </p>

    <ul>
        <li>4 dried seaweed sheets</li>
        <li>120g / 4.2 ounces spinach (regular or baby spinach)</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the spinach and parboil it in rapidly boiling water (30 seconds to 1 minute). Drain the water away and run some cold water over the spinach. Gently squeeze the spinach to remove any excess water. Put the spinach into a bowl. Add 1/8 tsp salt and 1/2 Tbsp sesame oil then mix them well.</li>
        <li>Pre-heat a pan/skillet. Add a small dash of cooking oil and spread it around the pan. Add the beaten egg and cook both sides well over medium heat. Place the egg omelette on a cutting board and cut it into long strips.

        </li>
        <li>In a heated pan, lightly cook the carrots, crab sticks and kimbap ham (about 1 min per ingredients), separately, and over medium heat. (Some people use these raw, but I prefer cooking them first for my kimbap.)</li>
    </ol>
